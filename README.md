## CustomSortedListview
Write an app with a text input view on top which takes N, where N is a series of unique numbers (for example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) of arbitrary length. 

The goal is to sort the numbers in ‘increasing, decreasing’ order and then output them in a ListView on the react native screen, where each number gets it’s own row.

For example, with the input: N = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 the output would be: 1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 5  

Here are a few more examples. 

Input: 1, 4, 6, 3
Output: 1, 4, 3, 6

Input: 7, 2, 3, 9
Output: 2, 7, 3, 9

input : 1, 2, 3
Output: 1, 3, 2

Input: -5, 4, 9, 10
Output: -5, 9, 4, 10

**TODO:** *negative numbers are not supported yet.*
